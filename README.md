Who is your Minecraft identical block twin?


After a discussion with Dan Aldred on Twitter, as a result of contributing blocks to
his 1000 block TNT explosion project, I came up with the idea of representing twitter
handles as minecraft blocks.


This way, as he reads in tweets and places blocks randomly, he can choose a block type
that represents that twitter handle. Now, as there are more twitter handles than there
are block types, this means we need an algorithm to turn handles into blocks.


Here it is - give it a try, and see if you can identify any of your "identical block twins"
- people with different Twitter handles that have the same block type as you!
